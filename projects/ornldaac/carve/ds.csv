The data were collected in situ using the Aventech AIMMS-30 Airborne Wind Sensor onboard the aircraft and are presented at 1-second intervals throughout each flight. The Winds instrument was available for flights in year 2015 only. The measurements included in this data set are most useful when paired with the scientific data collected by other CARVE airborne instruments.,CARVE_L1_FlightPath_Winds_1427,COMPLETE,1A,unprocessed instrument data with ancillary information,,,58.84,71.32,-168.07,-132.24,"POLYGON ((-132.24 58.84, -132.24 71.31999999999999, -168.07 71.31999999999999, -168.07 58.84, -132.24 58.84))"
