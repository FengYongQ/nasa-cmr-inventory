wind velocity and products derived from these measurements.  The data were
gathered during summer 1987 near Manhattan, Kansas as part of the First
International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field
Experiment (FIFE).  Data from July 11 have been used by the scientists of the
Wave Propagation Laboratory (ETL) of NOAA for intensive studies of turbulence
in the atmospheric boundary layer.

The instrument used to take the measurements was a short pulse (0.4
microseconds) carbon-dioxide Doppler lidar, operating at a wavelength of 10.6
micrometers and at a pulse repetition rate of 20 Hz.  The lidar measured wind
velocity using multiple VAD conical scans or crossed RHI scans, with a range
resolution of approximately 150 meters, and a maximum range of 6-10 kilometers
