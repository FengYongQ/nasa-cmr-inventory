The GRACE Level-1B RL03 data consists only of updated spacecraft attitude (SCA1B) and K-band inter-satellite ranging (KBR1B) data. All other Level-1B were not changed and it is recommended to use the RL02 products with the updated RL03 KBR1B and SCA1B products. The RL03 SCA1B data were corrected for a stellar aberration error in the onboard star tracker software and incorrect data weighting in the star tracker combination software. For the RL03 SCA1B data a new software module was developed that uses Kalman filtering, field of view error modeling, relative alignment adjustment and the inclusion of angular spacecraft body acceleration measurements from the ACC instrument. This new processing resulted in a significant reduction in high frequency noise and the elimination of jumps during transitions between dual and single star tracker operation.  The KBR1B product is updated as well because the KBR antenna phase center range correction, range rate correction and range acceleration are computed using the spacecraft attitude information (SCA1B).

These data are provided in a single data file in netCDF format, and can be used for analysis for ocean, ice, and hydrology phenomena. This version of the data employs a Coastal Resolution Improvement (CRI) filter that reduces signal leakage errors across coastlines. The water storage/height anomalies are given in equivalent water thickness units (cm). The solution provided here is derived from solving for monthly gravity field variations in terms of geolocated spherical cap mass concentration functions, rather than global spherical harmonic coefficients. Additionally, realistic geophysical information is introduced during the solution inversion to intrinsically remove correlated error. Thus, these Mascon grids do not need to be destriped or smoothed, like traditional spherical harmonic gravity solutions. The complete Mascon solution consists of 4,551 relatively independent estimates of surface mass change that have been derived using an equal-area 3-degree grid of individual mascons. A subset of these individual mascons span coastlines, and contain mixed land and ocean mass change signals.  In a post-processing step, the CRI filter is applied to those mixed land/ocean Mascons to separate land and ocean mass. The land mask used to perform this separation is provided in the same directory as this dataset. Since the individual mascons act as an inherent smoother on the gravity field, a set of optional gain factors (for continental hydrology applications) that can be applied to the solution to study mass change signals at sub-mascon resolution is also provided within the same data directory as the Mascon data.
