Version 4 of this dataset implements release 2.5 of ICOADS (International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set) and is supplemented by monthly GTS (Global Telecommunications Ship and buoy) system data.

Major revisions include updated and substantially more complete input data from the ICOADS release 2.5, revised EOTs and EOT acceptance criterion, updated SST quality control procedures, revised SST anomaly evaluation methods, updated bias adjustments of ship SSTs using the Hadley Centre Nighttime Marine Air Temperature dataset version 2 (HadNMAT2), and buoy SST bias adjustment not previously made in v3b.
