Version 4 of this dataset implements release 2.5 of ICOADS (International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set) and is supplemented by monthly GTS (Global Telecommunications Ship and buoy) system data.  As for the prior ERSST version, v4 implements Empirical Orthogonal Teleconnection analysis (EOT) but with an improved tuning method for sparsely sampled regions and periods. ERSST anomalies are computed with respect to a 1971-2000 monthly climatology.  The version 4 has been improved from previous version 3b. Major revisions include updated and substantially more complete input data from the ICOADS release 2.5, revised EOTs and EOT acceptance criterion, updated SST quality control procedures, revised SST anomaly evaluation methods, updated bias adjustments of ship SSTs using the Hadley Centre Nighttime Marine Air Temperature dataset version 2 (HadNMAT2), and buoy SST bias adjustment not previously made in v3b.

ERSST anomalies are computed with respect to a 1971-2000 monthly climatology.  The version 5 has been improved from previous version 4. Major improvements in v5 include: 1) Inclusion and use of new sources and new versions of input datasets, such as data from Argo floats (new source), ICOADS R3.0 (from R2.5), HadISST2 (from HadISST1) sea ice concentration, and 2) Improved methodologies, such as inclusion of additional statistical modes, less spatial-temporal smoothing, better quality control method, and bias correction with baseline to modern buoy observations. The new version improves the spatial structures and magnitudes of El Nino and La Nina events.
