The \n            obvious synergy of this combined observational capability is significant. With the ability \n            of the CPR to probe optically thick large-particle layers and the ability of the Lidar to \n            sense optically thin layers and tenuous cloud tops, the two instruments have the potential \n            of providing as complete a picture of the occurrence of cloud and aerosol as has been \n            compiled to date.  However, not only do the two instruments sense the atmosphere in \n            different ways, the macroscopic characteristics of the observations such as vertical \n            resolution, spatial resolution, and spatial frequency are quite different from one another.  \n            The pointing certainty of the two instruments also adds complexity to combining the two \n            data streams.  Our goal is to optimally merge these two data streams in order to produce \n            the most accurate quantitative description of the location of hydrometeor layers in the \n            atmosphere that is possible.  Beyond this primary goal, we will also attempt to extract \n            from the combined data streams the degree to which the volumes illuminated by the \n            cloudsat CPR are fully or partially filled by hydrometeors.   \n             \n            This document describes the algorithm that will be implemented operationally to \n            combine the CPR and Lidar data cloudmasks to meet the goals described above.

The objective of the  algorithm is to make use of liquid and ice water content estimates from the CloudSat Proﬁling Radar (CPR) to produce  estimates of broadband ﬂuxes and heating rates for each radar proﬁle. For a particular radar proﬁle, upwelling and down-  welling longwave and shortwave ﬂux proﬁles are calculated at discrete levels of the atmosphere. Corresponding heating  rates are inferred from these ﬂuxes. In order to perform these calculations, the algorithm makes use of a combination of  atmospheric state variables obtained from ECMWF reanalysis data, proﬁles of cloud ice and liquid water content obtained  from the CloudSat 2B-LWC and 2B-IWC products, and surface albedos obtained from seasonally-varying maps of surface  reﬂectance properties.

[1], and all quantitative and mathematical details may be obtained from  this source. An overview of the physical basis of the retrieval follows. \n             \n            The algorithm makes use of path integrated attenuation (PIA) due to hydrometeors as a geophysical measurement.  The method depends on the well-behaved relationship between the backscatter cross section of the ocean surface, σ0 , and  the wind speed, V at the ocean surface. Higher wind speeds cause greater roughening of the ocean surface, resulting in  increased scattering of microwave radiation away from the radar receiver and a lower resulting surface backscatter cross  section. The sea surface temperature (SST) of the ocean surface also inﬂuences the backscatter cross section through  variation of the index of refraction. A database of observations of the surface backscatter cross section under clear-sky  conditions, σclr , provides a background reference for the state of the surface when hydrometeors are absent. When cloud  or rain is present, the observed backscatter cross section is reduced by hydrometeor attenuation. This reduction allows  calculation of PIA given knowledge of the wind speed at the ocean surface (derived from a numerical model) and, to a  lesser extent, the SST [2]. \n            \n            The unattenuated radar reﬂectivity, Zu , near the surface is closely related to the presence of rain; the higher Zu the  more likely precipitation is occurring. Zu is the sum of the measured reﬂectivity, the PIA, and a component due to gaseous  attenuation, G (determined from the ECMWF-AUX temperature and moisture proﬁle). \n            \n            Multiple scattering within the precipitating column can be signiﬁcant for rainfall exceeding a few millimeter per  hour [3], so Monte Carlo modeling is used to simulate the relationship between rainfall and observed PIA for various  vertical proﬁles of precipitation. A model of the melting layer is also incorporated into the Monte Carlo calculations to  better represent the transition from snow to rain. This melting layer model aims to treat the attenuating characteristics  of melting snowﬂakes. The model follows snow (modeled through the discrete dipole approximation) falling through a  melting layer and melting into rain, assuming a constant lapse rate, Γe , of 6 ◦ C km−1 . \n            \n            Liquid or mixed precipitation layers are considered to extend to the height of the lowest continuous cloud layer, HCT L ,  as determined from the 2B-GEOPROF cloud mask, capped by the height of the freezing level, Hf , from ECMWF-AUX.  The effects of purely frozen precipitation on PIA are only considered when a core of 10 dBZ of greater reﬂectivity extends  through the freezing level, Hsig . When such a core is absent, melting is considered to start at the freezing level itself.  The combination of HCT L , Hf , and Hsig allow determination of the total depth of all precipitation, Dtot , and liquid  precipitation, Dliq .", "coll_shortname": "Cloudsat_2C-PRECIP-COLUMN", "coll_status": "COMPLETE", "coll_proclvl": "Not provided", "coll_proclvl_desc": null, "time_min": null, "time_max": null, "lat_min": -90.0, "lat_max": 90.0, "lon_min": -180.0, "lon_max": 180.0 }, "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ 180.0, -90.0 ], [ 180.0, 90.0 ], [ -180.0, 90.0 ], [ -180.0, -90.0 ], [ 180.0, -90.0 ] ] ] } },

Retrievals are performed  separately for the liquid and ice phases; the two sets of results are then combined in a simple way to  obtain a composite proﬁle that is consistent with the input measurements.  This radar-visible optical depth product uses a combination of measured radar reﬂectivity factor  (from the CloudSat 2B-GEOPROF product) together with estimates of visible optical dpeth (from  the CloudSat 2B-TAU product) to constrain the cloud retrievals more tightly than in the radar-only  product (2B-CWC-RO) and presumably yielding more accurate results. However, retrievals of visible  optical depth are difﬁcult or impossible in many cases, due to the complexity of the targets and the  simplifying assumptions made necessary by the data volumes associated with an operational satellite.  Rather than leaving a number of gaps in the RVOD product, a radar-onlly (RO) retrieval is performed  for those proﬁles where visible optical depth information is not available (as indicated by status ﬂags  in 2B-TAU). (Retrieved proﬁles based on an RO retrieval are indicated by a non-zero value of bit 7 in  RVOD_CWC_status: “Bad TAU input”.) The RVOD product is therefore a composite of RVOD and  RO retrieval solutions in which each retrieved proﬁle uses the maximum information available through  the CloudSat data system. For users wanting a more homogenous product, the 2B-CWC-RO product  (using radar only) continues to be available. \n                              \n                              The CWC algorithm creates a composite proﬁle from separate ice and liquid water retrievals. Both  of these retrievals assume that the radar proﬁle is due to a single phase of water, that is, that the entire  proﬁle consists of either liquid or ice, but not both. The resulting separate liquid and ice proﬁles  are then combined using a simple scheme based on temperature as reported by an ECMWF model.  While the combination algorithm results in a mixture of ice and liquid phases over that part of the  vertical proﬁle that has the proper temperature range, the user should be aware that the retrieval does  not attempt to retrieve mixed-phase cloud properties directly. Improvements are in the planning stages  to better handle the retrieval of mixed-phase cloud. \n                              \nThis document describes the algorithms that have been implemented in Release 4 (R04) of the \n2B-CWC-RVOD product (algorithm version 5.1).

The SST4 product has lower uncertainty, but due to sun glint can only be produced at night.
