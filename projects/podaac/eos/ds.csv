The CloudSat data range extends 50 scans to either end of the intersection curtain in order to provide context. The ﬁrst  and last 50 CloudSat scans in each ﬁle do not have matching TRMM information.

            The Cloudsat cloud profiling radar (CPR) and the Calipso Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with 
            Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP; hereafter referred as the Lidar) are slated to fly in 
            close coordination with one another when on orbit within the Aqua MODIS swath.  The 
            obvious synergy of this combined observational capability is significant. With the ability 
            of the CPR to probe optically thick large-particle layers and the ability of the Lidar to 
            sense optically thin layers and tenuous cloud tops, the two instruments have the potential 
            of providing as complete a picture of the occurrence of cloud and aerosol as has been 
            compiled to date.  However, not only do the two instruments sense the atmosphere in 
            different ways, the macroscopic characteristics of the observations such as vertical 
            resolution, spatial resolution, and spatial frequency are quite different from one another.  
            The pointing certainty of the two instruments also adds complexity to combining the two 
            data streams.  Our goal is to optimally merge these two data streams in order to produce 
            the most accurate quantitative description of the location of hydrometeor layers in the 
            atmosphere that is possible.  Beyond this primary goal, we will also attempt to extract 
            from the combined data streams the degree to which the volumes illuminated by the 
            cloudsat CPR are fully or partially filled by hydrometeors.   
             
            This document describes the algorithm that will be implemented operationally to 
            combine the CPR and Lidar data cloudmasks to meet the goals described above.  This 
            algorithm will 
            
            - Identify the hydrometeor layer base and top heights for up to five layers in each 
            vertical CPR profile.

      The algorithm retrieves the optical depth and effective radius using radar reflectivity measured by the CloudSat CPR, upwelling top of the atmosphere radiance measured by MODIS in several channels, and other ancillary data (eg. geolocation, time, and surface albedo). The retrieved values are spectral and represent the optical depth and effective 4adius in the short wave. Using CPR information about the distribution of cloud in the atmospheric column, estimates are then produced of the profile of cloud optical depth versus height in the column.

This document provides an overview of the 2B-FLXHR ﬂux and heating rate algorithm for CloudSat. The objective of the  algorithm is to make use of liquid and ice water content estimates from the CloudSat Proﬁling Radar (CPR) to produce  estimates of broadband ﬂuxes and heating rates for each radar proﬁle. For a particular radar proﬁle, upwelling and down-  welling longwave and shortwave ﬂux proﬁles are calculated at discrete levels of the atmosphere. Corresponding heating  rates are inferred from these ﬂuxes. In order to perform these calculations, the algorithm makes use of a combination of  atmospheric state variables obtained from ECMWF reanalysis data, proﬁles of cloud ice and liquid water content obtained  from the CloudSat 2B-LWC and 2B-IWC products, and surface albedos obtained from seasonally-varying maps of surface  reﬂectance properties. The remainder of this document describes the algorithm in greater detail. Section 2 provides an  overview of the theoretical basis upon which the algorithm is built. Sections 3 and 4 describe inputs to the algorithm and  detail its implementation. The output format for the product is summarized in Section 5 while instructions for the operator  can be found in Section 6.

            The basis of the work is outlined in Haynes et al. [1], and all quantitative and mathematical details may be obtained from  this source. An overview of the physical basis of the retrieval follows. 
             
            The algorithm makes use of path integrated attenuation (PIA) due to hydrometeors as a geophysical measurement.  The method depends on the well-behaved relationship between the backscatter cross section of the ocean surface, σ0 , and  the wind speed, V at the ocean surface. Higher wind speeds cause greater roughening of the ocean surface, resulting in  increased scattering of microwave radiation away from the radar receiver and a lower resulting surface backscatter cross  section. The sea surface temperature (SST) of the ocean surface also inﬂuences the backscatter cross section through  variation of the index of refraction. A database of observations of the surface backscatter cross section under clear-sky  conditions, σclr , provides a background reference for the state of the surface when hydrometeors are absent. When cloud  or rain is present, the observed backscatter cross section is reduced by hydrometeor attenuation. This reduction allows  calculation of PIA given knowledge of the wind speed at the ocean surface (derived from a numerical model) and, to a  lesser extent, the SST [2]. 
            
            The unattenuated radar reﬂectivity, Zu , near the surface is closely related to the presence of rain; the higher Zu the  more likely precipitation is occurring. Zu is the sum of the measured reﬂectivity, the PIA, and a component due to gaseous  attenuation, G (determined from the ECMWF-AUX temperature and moisture proﬁle). 
            
            Multiple scattering within the precipitating column can be signiﬁcant for rainfall exceeding a few millimeter per  hour [3], so Monte Carlo modeling is used to simulate the relationship between rainfall and observed PIA for various  vertical proﬁles of precipitation. A model of the melting layer is also incorporated into the Monte Carlo calculations to  better represent the transition from snow to rain. This melting layer model aims to treat the attenuating characteristics  of melting snowﬂakes. The model follows snow (modeled through the discrete dipole approximation) falling through a  melting layer and melting into rain, assuming a constant lapse rate, Γe , of 6 ◦ C km−1 . 
            
            Liquid or mixed precipitation layers are considered to extend to the height of the lowest continuous cloud layer, HCT L ,  as determined from the 2B-GEOPROF cloud mask, capped by the height of the freezing level, Hf , from ECMWF-AUX.  The effects of purely frozen precipitation on PIA are only considered when a core of 10 dBZ of greater reﬂectivity extends  through the freezing level, Hsig . When such a core is absent, melting is considered to start at the freezing level itself.  The combination of HCT L , Hf , and Hsig allow determination of the total depth of all precipitation, Dtot , and liquid  precipitation, Dliq .",Cloudsat_2C-PRECIP-COLUMN,COMPLETE,Not provided,,,,-90.0,90.0,-180.0,180.0,"POLYGON ((180 -90, 180 90, -180 90, -180 -90, 180 -90))"

            This product is calculated using data from the CloudSat Profiling Radar and other sources, including radiance measurements from the MODIS instrument on the Aqua platform, with which CloudSat will orbit in close formation. In practice, 2B-CWC simply obtains visible optical depth from the 2B-TAU product. A radar-only version of the retrieval has been implemented for use during the nighttime half of CloudSat&#039;s orbit when visible optical depth information will not be available. For continuity, the radar-only retrieval will also be run during the daytime half of the orbit.

The CloudSat Radar-Visible Optical Depth Cloud Water Content Product (2B-CWC-RVOD) contains  retrieved estimates of cloud liquid and ice water content, effective radius, and related quantities for  each radar proﬁle measured by the Cloud Proﬁling Radar on CloudSat. Retrievals are performed  separately for the liquid and ice phases; the two sets of results are then combined in a simple way to  obtain a composite proﬁle that is consistent with the input measurements.  This radar-visible optical depth product uses a combination of measured radar reﬂectivity factor  (from the CloudSat 2B-GEOPROF product) together with estimates of visible optical dpeth (from  the CloudSat 2B-TAU product) to constrain the cloud retrievals more tightly than in the radar-only  product (2B-CWC-RO) and presumably yielding more accurate results. However, retrievals of visible  optical depth are difﬁcult or impossible in many cases, due to the complexity of the targets and the  simplifying assumptions made necessary by the data volumes associated with an operational satellite.  Rather than leaving a number of gaps in the RVOD product, a radar-onlly (RO) retrieval is performed  for those proﬁles where visible optical depth information is not available (as indicated by status ﬂags  in 2B-TAU). (Retrieved proﬁles based on an RO retrieval are indicated by a non-zero value of bit 7 in  RVOD_CWC_status: “Bad TAU input”.) The RVOD product is therefore a composite of RVOD and  RO retrieval solutions in which each retrieved proﬁle uses the maximum information available through  the CloudSat data system. For users wanting a more homogenous product, the 2B-CWC-RO product  (using radar only) continues to be available. 
                              
                              The CWC algorithm creates a composite proﬁle from separate ice and liquid water retrievals. Both  of these retrievals assume that the radar proﬁle is due to a single phase of water, that is, that the entire  proﬁle consists of either liquid or ice, but not both. The resulting separate liquid and ice proﬁles  are then combined using a simple scheme based on temperature as reported by an ECMWF model.  While the combination algorithm results in a mixture of ice and liquid phases over that part of the  vertical proﬁle that has the proper temperature range, the user should be aware that the retrieval does  not attempt to retrieve mixed-phase cloud properties directly. Improvements are in the planning stages  to better handle the retrieval of mixed-phase cloud. 
                              
This document describes the algorithms that have been implemented in Release 4 (R04) of the 
2B-CWC-RVOD product (algorithm version 5.1). For each radar proﬁle, the algorithms will 
                              
- Examine the cloud mask in 2B-GEOPROF to determine which bins in the column contain cloud, 
                              
- Examine the 2B-CLDCLASS product to determine if any cloudy bins have an undetermined or invalid cloud type (indicating a problematic proﬁle), 
                              
- Examine the 2B-TAU product to determine if the visible optical depth retrieval is bad, missing, or failed to converge, 
                              
- Assign a priori values to the liquid and ice particle size distribution parameters in each cloudy bin based on climatology, temperature, or other criteria, 
                              
-  Using the a priori values and radar measurements from 2B-GEOPROF (and visible optical depth from 2B-TAU, if available), retrieve liquid and ice particle size distribution parameters for each 
cloudy bin. Derive effective radius, water content, and related quantities from the retrieved size 
distributions for both liquid and ice phases, together with associated uncertainties, 
                              
- Create a composite proﬁle by using the retrieved ice properties at temperatures colder than 

−20◦ C, the retrieved liquid properties at temperatures warmer than 0◦ C, and a linear combination of the two in intermediate temperatures,",Cloudsat_2B-CWC-RVOD,COMPLETE,Not provided,,,,-90.0,90.0,-180.0,180.0,"POLYGON ((180 -90, 180 90, -180 90, -180 -90, 180 -90))"

The SST4 product has lower uncertainty, but due to sun glint can only be produced at night. To generate the L3 products the L2 pixels are binned into an integerized sinusoidal area grid (ISEAG) and mapped into an equidistant cylindrical (also known as Platte Carre) projection.

The algorithm employs a series of visible and infrared threshold and consistency tests to specify confidence levels that an unobstructed view of the Earth's surface is observed. 

The Terra MODIS Photovoltaic (PVLWIR) bands 27-30 are known to experience an electronic crosstalk contamination. The influence of the crosstalk has gradually increased over the mission lifetime, causing for example, earth surface features to become prominent in atmospheric band 27, increased detector striping, and long term drift in the radiometric bias of these bands. The drift has compromised the climate quality of C6 Terra MODIS L2 products that depend significantly on these bands, including cloud mask (MOD35), cloud fraction and cloud top properties (MOD06), and total precipitable water (MOD07). A linear crosstalk correction algorithm has been developed and tested by MCST.The electronic crosstalk correction was made to the calibration algorithm for bands 27-30 and implemented into C6.1 operational L1B processing. This implementation greatly improves the performance of the cloud mask.

The shortname for this Level-2 MODIS cloud mask product is MYD35_L2 and the principal investigator for this product is MODIS scientist Dr. Paul Menzel ( paulm@ssec.wisc.edu).

The algorithm employs a series of visible and infrared threshold and consistency tests to specify confidence levels that an unobstructed view of the Earth's surface is observed. 


The Terra MODIS Photovoltaic (PVLWIR) bands 27-30 are known to experience an electronic crosstalk contamination. The influence of the crosstalk has gradually increased over the mission lifetime, causing for example, earth surface features to become prominent in atmospheric band 27, increased detector striping, and long term drift in the radiometric bias of these bands. The drift has compromised the climate quality of C6 Terra MODIS L2 products that depend significantly on these bands, including cloud mask (MOD35), cloud fraction and cloud top properties (MOD06), and total precipitable water (MOD07). A linear crosstalk correction algorithm has been developed and tested by MCST.The electronic crosstalk correction was made to the calibration algorithm for bands 27-30 and implemented into C6.1 operational L1B processing. This implementation greatly improves the performance of the cloud mask.

Earth Science Information Partner (WP-ESIP) to investigate the application of
the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection radiometer (ASTER) data
for producing enhanced terrain products. ASTER is an instrument scheduled to
fly on-board the NASA Earth Observation System (EOS) satellite EOS AM-1.  The
ASTER data set was simulated from airborne flights of the Airborne Visible and
Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and the Thermal Infrared Multispectral
Scanner (TIMS). MRJ's Digital Terrain Features (DTF) product is a combination
of vector and raster GIS layers which describe terrain features.

The Death Valley data set is a simulation of ASTER Level 1B data in units of
radiance using the nominal instrument gain settings. It is arranged in three
smaller data sets, one for each subsystem (Visible Near Infrared (VNIR),
ShortWave Infrared (SWIR), Thermal Infrared (TIR).) The data set was created
from spectrally resampled AVIRIS images and TIMS images, that were then
co-registered, and spatially resampled to the appropriate ASTER pixel sizes for
each subsystem (15m - VNIR, 30m - SWIR, and 90m -TIR). The SWIR and TIR data
sets were then sized up using pixel replication to have the same number of
samples and lines as the VNIR data set. The area covered by the data is 12 x 51
km. The data set was registered to USGS 1:100,000 Digitial Line Graph (DLG)
vector data.

The data set consists of land cover classification within Death Valley, digital
elevation from 7.5 minute USGS Digital Elevation Model (DEM), slope and relief
from the digital elevation, transportation and hydrography vector layers from
the USGS 1:1,000,000 DLG.",WP-ESIP_ASTER,COMPLETE,Not provided,,,,36.0,36.0,-117.0,-116.0,"POLYGON ((-116 36, -116 36, -117 36, -117 36, -116 36))"

The principal aim of the SLSTR instrument is to maintain continuity with the AATSR series of instruments. The SLSTR instrument design incorporates the basic functionality of AATSR in addition to new, more advanced features including a wider swath, new channels (including two channels dedicated to fire detection), and higher resolution in some channels. The principal objective of SLSTR products is to provide global and regional Sea and Land Surface Temperature (SST, LST) to a very high level of accuracy (better than 0.3 K) for both climatological and meteorological applications.
