The land surface temperature required in the estimation procedure is estimated from the 36.5 GHz vertically-polarized brightness temperature, using a regression relationship.

This dataset is part of MEaSUREs 2012 Program, and represent Aqua/AIRS-Aura/MLS collocation indexes, in netCDF-4  format. These data map AIRS profile indexes to those of MLS.

The A-Train provides water vapor (H2O) retrievals from both the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). While AIRS loses sensitivity to H2O at the elevated portions of the upper troposphere (UT), MLS cannot detect H2O below 316 hPa. Therefore, to obtain a full profile of H2O in the whole column of air, this dataset manages to join the two products together by utilizing their own averaging kernels (AK). In doing so, the dataset builds a solid H2O of the whole column of air, which will help understand the H2O budget and many processes governing the humidity around the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS).

The MZM product averages retrievals that meet the criteria for a good retrieval as determined by error flags in the Level 2 data. A good retrieval is defined as satisfying the following conditions:

 1) Profile Error Flag = 0 or 1 (0 = good retrieval; 1 = solar zenith angle > 84 degrees).
 2) Total Error Flags = 0, 1, 2 or 5 (0 = good retrieval; 1 = not used; 2 = solar zenith angle > 84 degrees; large discrepancy between profile total and best total ozone).

NOTE - Total error flag = 5 is anomalously applied at high latitudes and high solar zenith angles where the B-Pair total ozone estimate is not as reliable as the ozone profile under these conditions. This error flag may be removed in future version of algorithm.

The zonal means computed for each month are screened according to the following statistical criteria:

 1) Number of good retrievals for the month greater than or equal to 2/3 of the samples for a nominal month.
 2) Mean latitude of good retrievals less than or equal to 1 degree from center of latitude band.
 3) Mean time of good retrievals less than or equal to 4 days from center of month (i.e., day = 15).",BUVN04L3zm,COMPLETE,3,,,,-90.0,90.0,-180.0,180.0,"POLYGON ((180 -90, 180 90, -180 90, -180 -90, 180 -90))"

The GFCC Surface Reflectance Estimates Multi-Year Global dataset is derived from the enhanced Global Land Survey (GLS) datasets for epochs centered on the years 1990, 2000, 2005, and 2010. The GLS datasets are composed of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images at 30 meter resolution. Data available for this product represent the best available “leaf-on” date during the peak growing season. The original GLS datasets were enhanced with supplemental Landsat images when data were incomplete for the epoch or inadequate for analysis due to acquisition during “leaf-off” seasons. The enhanced GLS data were acquired June 1984 through August 2011. Atmospheric corrections were applied to seven visible bands to estimate surface reflectance by compensating for the scattering and absorption of radiance by atmospheric conditions. GFCC30SR is a multi-file data product. The surface reflectance data products are used as source data for other datasets in the GFCC collection.

      The ""individual"" daily flux data files, produced for each individual satellite, are also available in HDF-EOS5, although from different collections:
      GSSTF_Fxx_3, where Fxx are the individual satellites (F08, F10, etc..)
      
      The input data sets used for this recent GSSTF production include the upgraded and improved datasets such as the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) Version-6 (V6) product of brightness temperature [Tb], total precipitable water [W], and wind speed [U] produced by the Wentz of Remote Sensing Systems (RSS), as well as the NCEP/DOE Reanalysis-2 (R2) product of sea skin temperature [SKT], 2-meter air temperature [Tair], and sea level pressure [SLP]. Relevant to this MEaSUREs project, these are converted to HDF-EOS5, and are stored in the GSSTF_NCEP_3 collection. 
      
      Please use these products with care and proper citations, i.e., properly indicating your applications with, e.g., ""using the combined 2001 data file of Set1"" or ""using the 2001 F13 data file"".

      Special notes:
      
        (a) For Y2006, Y2007 and Y2008, the current Combined daily data files do not include the F15 Individual daily data files due to problematic calibration in F15. The Combined daily files will be updated for those three years once an improved set of Individual daily data files are produced using corrected and updated SSM/I F15 input files.
      
        (b) The current Combined daily data files are produced with at most 4 combined satellites,
             i.e., F10, F11, F13 and F14 for May-Nov 1997,
               and F11, F13, F14 and F15 for Jan-May 2000.

This is the fine resolution version of the previously released GSSTFM.2c. 

This is the Monthly product; data are projected to equidistant Grid that covers the globe at 0.25x00.25 degree cell size, resulting in data arrays of 1440x720 size. The monthly product is a result of averaging of a month worth of daily GSSTF3 files. Starting with Version 3, the ""WB"" variable, ""lowest 500-m precipitable water"" has been discontinued.  

The monthly temporal and one-degree spatial resolution of the product can be used to examining climate variability at these scales. Oceanic evaporation contributes to the net fresh water input to the oceans and drives the upper ocean density structure and consequently the circulation of the oceans.

     The short name for this product is GSSTFM.

GSSTF version 2b (Shie et al. 2010, Shie et al. 2009) generally agreed better with available ship measurements obtained from several field experiments in 1999 than GSSTF2 (Chou et al. 2003) did in all three flux components, i.e., latent heat flux [LHF], sensible heat flux [SHF], and wind stress [WST] (Shie 2010a,b).  GSSTF2b was also found favorable, particularly for LHF and SHF, in an intercomparison study that accessed eleven products of ocean surface turbulent fluxes, in which GSSTF2 and GSSTF2b were also included (Brunke et al. 2011).  However, a temporal trend appeared in the globally averaged LHF of GSSTF2b, particularly post year 2000.  Shie (2010a,b) attributed the LHF trend to the trends originally found in the globally averaged SSM/I Tb's, i.e., Tb(19v), Tb(19h), Tb(22v) and Tb(37v), which were used to retrieve the GSSTF2b bottom-layer (the lowest atmospheric 500 meter layer) precipitable water [WB], then the surface specific humidity [Qa], and subsequently LHF. The SSM/I Tb's trends were recently found mainly due to the variations/trends of Earth incidence angle (EIA) in the SSM/I satellites (Hilburn and Shie 2011a,b).  They have further developed an algorithm properly resolving the EIA problem and successfully reproducing the corrected Tb's by genuinely removing the ""artifactitious"" trends.  An upgraded production of GSSTF2c (Shie et al. 2011) using the corrected Tb's has been completed very recently. 

GSSTF2c shows a significant improvement in the resultant WB, and subsequently the retrieved LHF - the temporal trends of WB and LHF are greatly reduced after the proper adjustments/treatments in the SSM/I Tb's (Shie and Hilburn 2011).  In closing, we believe that the insightful ""Rice Cooker Theory"" by Shie (2010a,b), i.e., ""To produce a good and trustworthy 'output product' (delicious 'cooked rice') depends not only on a well-functioned 'model/algorithm' ('rice cooker'), but also on a genuine and reliable 'input data' ('raw rice') with good quality"" should help us better comprehend the impact of the improved Tb on the subsequently retrieved LHF of GSSTF2c. 

This is the Daily (24-hour) product; data are projected to equidistant Grid that covers the globe at 1x1 degree cell size, resulting in data arrays of 360x180 size. 

A finer resolution, 0.25 deg,  of this product has been released as Version 3. 

The GSSTF, Version 2c, daily fluxes have first been produced for each individual available SSM/I satellite tapes (e.g., F08, F10, F11, F13, F14 and F15). Then, the Combined daily fluxes are produced by averaging (equally weighted) over available flux data/files from various satellites.  These Combined daily flux data are considered as the ""final"" GSSTF, Version 2c, and are stored in this HDF-EOS5 collection.
      
There are only one set of GSSTF, Version 2c, Combined data, ""Set1"" 
            
The ""individual"" daily flux data files, produced for each individual satellite, are also available in HDF-EOS5, although from different collections:
      GSSTF_Fxx_2c, where Fxx are the individual satellites (F08, F10, etc..)
      
      The input data sets used for this recent GSSTF production include the upgraded and improved datasets such as the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) Version-6 (V6) product of brightness temperature [Tb], total precipitable water [W], and wind speed [U] produced by the Wentz of Remote Sensing Systems (RSS), as well as the NCEP/DOE Reanalysis-2 (R2) product of sea skin temperature [SKT], 2-meter air temperature [Tair], and sea level pressure [SLP]. Relevant to this MEaSUREs project, these are converted to HDF-EOS5, and are stored in the GSSTF_NCEP_2c collection.

        (a) For Y2006, Y2007 and Y2008, the current Combined daily data files do not include the F15 Individual daily data files due to problematic calibration in F15. The Combined daily files will be updated for those three years once an improved set of Individual daily data files are produced using corrected and updated SSM/I F15 input files.
      
        (b) The current Combined daily data files are produced with at most 4 combined satellites,
             i.e., F10, F11, F13 and F14 for May-Nov 1997,
               and F11, F13, F14 and F15 for Jan-May 2000.

GSSTF version 2b (Shie et al. 2010, Shie et al. 2009) generally agreed better with available ship measurements obtained from several field experiments in 1999 than GSSTF2 (Chou et al. 2003) did in all three flux components, i.e., latent heat flux [LHF], sensible heat flux [SHF], and wind stress [WST] (Shie 2010a,b).  GSSTF2b was also found favorable, particularly for LHF and SHF, in an intercomparison study that accessed eleven products of ocean surface turbulent fluxes, in which GSSTF2 and GSSTF2b were also included (Brunke et al. 2011).  However, a temporal trend appeared in the globally averaged LHF of GSSTF2b, particularly post year 2000.  Shie (2010a,b) attributed the LHF trend to the trends originally found in the globally averaged SSM/I Tb's, i.e., Tb(19v), Tb(19h), Tb(22v) and Tb(37v), which were used to retrieve the GSSTF2b bottom-layer (the lowest atmospheric 500 meter layer) precipitable water [WB], then the surface specific humidity [Qa], and subsequently LHF. The SSM/I Tb's trends were recently found mainly due to the variations/trends of Earth incidence angle (EIA) in the SSM/I satellites (Hilburn and Shie 2011a,b).  They have further developed an algorithm properly resolving the EIA problem and successfully reproducing the corrected Tb's by genuinely removing the ""artifactitious"" trends.  An upgraded production of GSSTF2c (Shie et al. 2011) using the corrected Tb's has been completed very recently. 

GSSTF2c shows a significant improvement in the resultant WB, and subsequently the retrieved LHF - the temporal trends of WB and LHF are greatly reduced after the proper adjustments/treatments in the SSM/I Tb's (Shie and Hilburn 2011).  In closing, we believe that the insightful ""Rice Cooker Theory"" by Shie (2010a,b), i.e., ""To produce a good and trustworthy 'output product' (delicious 'cooked rice') depends not only on a well-functioned 'model/algorithm' ('rice cooker'), but also on a genuine and reliable 'input data' ('raw rice') with good quality"" should help us better comprehend the impact of the improved Tb on the subsequently retrieved LHF of GSSTF2c. 

This is the Monthly Climatology product; data are projected to equidistant Grid that covers the globe at 1x1 degree cell size, resulting in data arrays of 360x180 size.

The COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3 mission consists of a six-satellite constellation launched in 2006.  Each satellite carries the IGOR GPS receiver and is equipped with fore and aft looking antenna to track both setting and rising occultations.  The constellation provides globally distributed measurements across different local times.  The TerraSAR-X (TSX) is a X-band SAR imaging satellite with GPS RO being a secondary measurement.  It also carries an IGOR receiver and has been collecting GPS RO measurements since 2011.  The instrument tracks the L-band microwave signal broadcast by a GPS satellite in a limb-viewing geometry. The IGOR receivers on COSMIC and TSX are capable of tracking the GPS signals in open loop through the middle to lower troposphere, which is essential for obtaining data with high quality for PBL height estimation, especially at low latitudes.  The refractivity profiles from COSMIC and TSX form the basis for this PBL height product.



For each occultation, the PBL height is calculated as the height where the vertical gradient of the refractivity (dN/dz) is minimum.  This algorithm is designed to locate the height where a large vertical change in refractivity occurs, corresponding to the transition from the free troposphere to the PBL.   More details can be found in Ao et al. (2012).  Each PBL height is associated with a time (starting time of the occultation) and location (latitude and longitude of the tangent point at the minimum altitude).  The PBL height data are then binned into 2 degree x 2 degree latitude/longitude regions and averaged to produce the mean and standard deviation values in the climatology products.  The refractivity profile has a vertical resolution of about 200 m and represents an along path horizontal averaging of ~100 km.  Thus, occultations with tangent points near the coast may represent averaging over both land and ocean and should be interpreted with care. 

The refractivity gradient method used here is not the only method that can be used to estimate the PBL height.  Other algorithms have been proposed, including looking at ""breakpoint"" instead of minimum gradient, wavelet covariance transform, and using variables like bending angles or specific humidity instead of refractivity.

The data products were produced by the RADARSAT Geophysical Processing System (RGPS), a project supported by the NASA MEaSUREs program. The 4 types of products are: ice motion, ice deformation, ice age and thickness, and radar backscatter. The primary data source for the analysis is the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) on RADARSAT-1, a Canadian polar-orbiting satellite that provided data coverage from October 1996 through May 2008.
 
Each product contains monthly measurements of ice motion and derived parameters over the Arctic Ocean sea ice cover. The analysis involves laying a 10km by 10km grid over a set of RADARSAT orbits covering the sea ice cover during an initial 3-day period of a season. The grid points are then tracked over each ensuing 3-day time period throughout the season. The changes in the cells defined by the grid points are used to characterize the evolution of the ice within each cell. We produce these measurements for two seasons: 1) winter usually covers November through mid-May, and 2) summer covers mid-May into mid-August.
      
 The 4 data products resulting from these measurements are:
      
1) Ice Motion ? a record of the time and location of each point within the initial grid as tracked on RADARSAT images at approximate 3-day intervals. Note that a very small fraction of the points may be lost during the season through advection out of the Arctic basin, loss of ice, or untrackability of the ice cover.
      
       2) Deformation ? a record of the divergence, vorticity and shear occurring within each cell. As the verticies of each cell move within a time step, the kinematic properties can be calculated to characterize the response of the ice cover to stresses induced by wind and ocean currents.
      
      3) Ice Age and Thickness ? a record of the area, age and thickness of new ice and ridged ice that result from cell area changes. A spatial and temporal distribution of these ice areas is kept for each cell. If the area of a cell increases within a time step, an area of new ice is created. The ice thickness within all the new ice areas created during the season is increased using air temperature information. When the cell area decreases, the thinnest ice areas are rafted or ridged, depending on their thickness. The thickness of areas of ridged ice are also grown in time. 
      
      4) Backscatter ? a record of the radiometric properties of the ice within each cell. A histogram of the radar brightness is kept within each cell at each time step, allowing the user to deduce multi-year ice fractions of the ice cover.",JPL-RGPS-0001,ACTIVE,Not provided,,,,65.0,90.0,-180.0,180.0,"POLYGON ((180 65, 180 90, -180 90, -180 65, 180 65))"

The catalogue MSAQSO2L4 file contains the site coordinates, source type, country, source name, annual SO2 emissions and uncertainties, and the number of EOS Aura/OMI satellite SO2 measurements used for emissions estimates near each source. 

The 2018 data have been recently added to the catalogue and the minor version in the file name is now upgraded to v01-04.  There are no systematic differences between the old  and new minor versions. The fitting areas are a slightly  different for some sites, but the resulting differences in the data are within the known uncertainties ranges. A major update to the catalogue is aniticipated in the summer of 2019.

The emissions  estimates are based on the fitting of the operational Aura/OMI planetary boundary layer (PBL) SO2 data produced with the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm (10.5067/Aura/OMI/DATA2022) and a site-specific AMF adjustment  for each site (Fioletov et al., 2016). The emission estimate method for linking OMI level 2 SO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) to emissions is based on a fit of OMI VCDs to an empirical plume model developed to describe the SO2 spatial distribution (as seen by OMI) near emissions point sources. The plume model assumes that the SO2 concentrations emitted from a point source decline exponentially along wind direction and are affected by turbulent diffusion that can be described by a 2D Gaussian function. The average  SO2 mass is derived from the fit and the emission rate is calculated as the ratio between the total mass and the prescribed SO2 lifetime.",MSAQSO2L4,ACTIVE,4,,,,-90.0,90.0,-180.0,180.0,"POLYGON ((180 -90, 180 90, -180 90, -180 -90, 180 -90))"

Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) is a short-lived gas primarily produced by volcanoes, power plants, refineries, metal smelting and burning of fossil fuels. Where SO2 remains near the Earth's surface, it is toxic, causes acid rain, and degrades air quality.

The rationale of the project is to reduce the error from the input meteorological forcing and provide a variety of widely-used PET methods for different research and application purposes.

PET is estimated using three methods: Penman open-water method (Penman), Priestley-Taylor method (PT), Reference crop evapotranspiration using the UN Food and Agricultural Organization approach (FAO). The Penman equation assumes PET occurs from an open water surface and calculates PET based on observations of surface net radiation, near-surface air temperature, wind speed, and specific humidity (Shuttleworth, 1993). The PT equation calculates PET based on surface net radiation and near-surface air temperature and does not account for the aerodynamic component (Priestley and Taylor, 1972). The FAO equation is a specific application of the Penman-Monteith equation for crop and short-grass reference surfaces and is based on surface net radiation, near-surface air temperature, wind speed, and specific humidity (Allen, 1998).

 2) Total Error Flags = 0, 1, 2 or 5 (0 = good retrieval; 1 = not used; 2 = solar zenith angle > 84 degrees; large discrepancy between profile total and best total ozone).

NOTE - Total error flag = 5 is anomalously applied at high latitudes and high solar zenith angles where the B-Pair total ozone estimate is not as reliable as the ozone profile under these conditions. This error flag may be removed in future version of algorithm.

The zonal means computed for each month are screened according to the following statistical criteria:

 1) Number of good retrievals for the month greater than or equal to 2/3 of the samples for a nominal month.
 2) Mean latitude of good retrievals less than or equal to 1 degree from center of latitude band.
 3) Mean time of good retrievals less than or equal to 4 days from center of month (i.e., day = 15).",SBUV2N18L3zm,COMPLETE,3,,,,-90.0,90.0,-180.0,180.0,"POLYGON ((180 -90, 180 90, -180 90, -180 -90, 180 -90))"
