It provides salinity, density, temperature and sound velocity of the water column. The AXCTDs were jettisoned from a plane, once the AXCTD hit the water a probe released to measure the physical properties of the water. This provided measurements of the ocean's physical characteristics around Greenland, where a ship would have had difficulties maneuvering. The AXCTDs are part of the Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) project. The goal of the project is to find out what contributions the ocean has on Greenland's melting glaciers.",OMG_L2_AXCTD,NOT PROVIDED,L2,,,,59.1,83.6,73.6,180.0,"POLYGON ((180 59.1, 180 83.59999999999999, 73.59999999999999 83.59999999999999, 73.59999999999999 59.1, 180 59.1))"
