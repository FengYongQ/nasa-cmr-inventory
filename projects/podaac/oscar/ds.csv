The horizontal velocity is directly estimated from sea surface height, surface vector wind and sea surface temperature data.  These input data sources are derived from various satellites and in situ instruments. The model formulation combines geostrophic, Ekman and Stommel shear dynamics, and a complementary term from the surface buoyancy gradient.  Data are on a 1 degree grid with a 5 day resolution.
