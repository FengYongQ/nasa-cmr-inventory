This is an along-track dataset that takes takes the high frequency SGDR data and retracks it to remove the waveforms that show land contamination. Therefore these data are provided at 20 Hz. It is similar to the Jason-2 SGDR data except that it also includes ALES variables for the range, significant wave height and sigma0 so that the user can calculate the retracked SSHA.",ALES_L2_OST_JASON2_V1,NOT PROVIDED,2,,,,-66.0,66.0,-180.0,180.0,"POLYGON ((180 -66, 180 66, -180 66, -180 -66, 180 -66))"

It has a 5 hour time lag due to the time needed to recalculate the orbit and SSHA.  The GPS orbits have been shown to be more accurate than the DORIS orbits on a near real time scale and therefore produces a more accurate SSHA.",OSTM_L2_OST_OGDR_GPS,NOT PROVIDED,2,,,,-66.0,66.0,-180.0,180.0,"POLYGON ((180 -66, 180 66, -180 66, -180 -66, 180 -66))"
