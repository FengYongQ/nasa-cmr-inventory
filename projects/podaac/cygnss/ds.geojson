This version supersedes Version 2.0. Other useful scientific and engineering measurement parameters include the DDM of Normalized Bistatic Radar Cross Section (NBRCS), the Delay Doppler Map Average (DDMA) of the NBRCS near the specular reflection point, and the Leading Edge Slope (LES) of the integrated delay waveform. The L1 dataset contains a number of other engineering and science measurement parameters, including sets of quality flags\/indicators, error estimates, and bias estimates as well as a variety of orbital, spacecraft\/sensor health, timekeeping, and geolocation parameters. At most, 8 netCDF data files (each file corresponding to a unique spacecraft in the CYGNSS constellation) are provided each day; under nominal conditions, there are typically 6-8 spacecraft retrieving data each day, but this can be maximized to 8 spacecraft under special circumstances in which higher than normal retrieval frequency is needed (i.e., during tropical storms and or hurricanes). Latency is approximately 6 days (or better) from the last recorded measurement time. The Version 2.1 release represents the second science-quality release. Here is a summary of improvements that reflect the quality of the Version 2.1 data release: 1) data is now available when the CYGNSS satellites are rolled away from nadir during orbital high beta-angle periods, resulting in a significant amount of additional data; 2) correction to coordinate frames result in more accurate estimates of receiver antenna gain at the specular point; 3) improved calibration for analog-to-digital conversion results in better consistency between CYGNSS satellites measurements at nearly the same location and time; 4) improved GPS EIRP and transmit antenna pattern calibration results in significantly reduced PRN-dependence in the observables;  5) improved estimation of the location of the specular point within the DDM; 6) an altitude-dependent scattering area is used to normalize the scattering cross section (v2.0 used a simpler  scattering area model that varied with incidence and azimuth angles but not altitude); 7) corrections added for noise floor-dependent biases in scattering cross section and leading edge slope of delay waveform observed in the v2.0 data. Users should also note that the receiver antenna pattern calibration is not applied per-DDM-bin in this v2.1 release.", "coll_shortname": "CYGNSS_L1_V2.1", "coll_status": "NOT PROVIDED", "coll_proclvl": "1", "coll_proclvl_desc": null, "time_min": null, "time_max": null, "lat_min": 40.0, "lat_max": 40.0, "lon_min": -180.0, "lon_max": 180.0 }, "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ 180.0, 40.0 ], [ 180.0, 40.0 ], [ -180.0, 40.0 ], [ -180.0, 40.0 ], [ 180.0, 40.0 ] ] ] } },

The reported sample locations are determined by the specular points corresponding to the Delay Doppler Maps (DDMs). Only one netCDF-4 data file is produced each day (each file containing data from a combination of up to 8 unique CYGNSS spacecraft) with a latency of approximately 1 to 2 months from the last recorded measurement time. Version 1.0 represents the first release. The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS), launched on 15 December 2016, is a NASA Earth System Science Pathfinder Mission that was launched with the purpose to collect the first frequent space-based measurements of surface wind speeds in the inner core of tropical cyclones. Made up of a constellation of eight micro-satellites, the CYGNSS observatories provide nearly gap-free Earth coverage with a mean (i.e., average) revisit time of seven hours and a median revisit time of three hours. The 35 degree orbital inclination allows CYGNSS to measure ocean surface winds between approximately 38 degrees North and 38 degrees South latitude using an innovative combination of all-weather performance Global Positioning System (GPS) L-band ocean surface reflectometry to penetrate the clouds and heavy precipitation. The Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) algorithm is what is used in this dataset to estimate the latent and sensible heat fluxes and their respective transfer coefficients. While COARE's initial intentions were for low to moderate wind speeds, the version used for this product, COARE 3.5, has been verified with direct in situ flux measurements for wind speeds up to 25 m\/s. As CYGNSS does not provide air\/sea temperature, humidity, surface pressure or density, the producer of this dataset obtains these values from the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA-2), which uses data assimilation to combine all available in situ and satellite observation data with an initial estimate of the atmospheric state, provided by a global atmospheric model. Since the MERRA-2 data is only updated on monthly intervals, this corresponding heat flux dataset is likewise updated on a monthly interval to reflect the latest data available from MERRA-2, thus accounting for measurement latency, with respect to CYGNSS observables, ranging from 1 to 2 months. The data from this release compares well with in situ buoy data, including: Kuroshio Extension Observatory (KEO), National Data Buoy Center (NDBC), Ocean Sustained Interdisciplinary Time-series Environment observation System (OceanSITES), Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA), Research Moored Array for African-Asian-Australian Monsoon Analysis and Prediction (RAMA), and the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) array. As this marks only the first data release, future work is expected to provide comparisons and validation with various field campaigns (e.g., PISTON, CAMP2Ex) as well as more buoy data, especially at higher flux estimates.", "coll_shortname": "CYGNSS_L2_SURFACE_FLUX_V1.0", "coll_status": "NOT PROVIDED", "coll_proclvl": "2", "coll_proclvl_desc": null, "time_min": null, "time_max": null, "lat_min": 40.0, "lat_max": 40.0, "lon_min": -180.0, "lon_max": 180.0 }, "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ 180.0, 40.0 ], [ 180.0, 40.0 ], [ -180.0, 40.0 ], [ -180.0, 40.0 ], [ 180.0, 40.0 ] ] ] } },

The Version 2.1 release represents the second science-quality release. Here is a summary of improvements that reflect the quality of the Version 2.1 data release: 1) revised Geophysical Model Functions (GMFs) for both Fully Developed Seas (FDS) and Young Seas with Limited Fetch conditions, to be consistent with the calibration changes made to the v2.1 Level 1 science data products.; 2) Revised covariance matrix between DDMA and LES versions of the FDS wind speed retrieval, used by the minimum variance estimator, resulting from changes made to the v2.1 Level 1 science data products; 3) Revised debiasing algorithm coefficients used by the FDS L2 retrieval algorithm, resulting from changes made to the v2.1 Level 2 science data products; 4) revised quality control (Q\/C) flags related to the required level of consistency between DDMA and LES versions of the FDS wind speed retrieval (the errors in the two retrievals are now less correlated so larger discrepancies are allowed; if either retrieval is not available, the sample receives a fatal Q\/C flag); 5) new Q\/C flag related to the block type of the GPS satellite which provided the transmitted signal. Samples using block II-F signals receive a fatal Q\/C flag due to the higher level of uncertainty in their radiated power; 6) revised wind speed uncertainty values as a function of RCG and wind speed, plus a new dependence of the uncertainty on GPS block type to reflect the higher uncertainty in GPS radiated power for block II-F satellites.", "coll_shortname": "CYGNSS_L2_V2.1", "coll_status": "NOT PROVIDED", "coll_proclvl": "2", "coll_proclvl_desc": null, "time_min": null, "time_max": null, "lat_min": 40.0, "lat_max": 40.0, "lon_min": -180.0, "lon_max": 180.0 }, "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ 180.0, 40.0 ], [ 180.0, 40.0 ], [ -180.0, 40.0 ], [ -180.0, 40.0 ], [ 180.0, 40.0 ] ] ] } },
