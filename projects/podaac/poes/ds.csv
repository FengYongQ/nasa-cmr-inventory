Among the twenty channels in the HIRS instrument, channel 12 measures upper tropospheric water vapor (UTWV). Multiple polar orbiting satellites in the NOAA Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) series and MetOp-A have carried HIRS instruments. Due to the independence in calibration of the individual HIRS instruments, biases exist between satellites. Examination of the intersatellite biases shows that the biases are scene brightness temperature dependent. These HIRS channel 12 measurements from the NOAA POES and MetOp-A are calibrated to a baseline satellite based on intersatellite bias correction data. The differences from the last version include that the dataset is now provided as monthly mean 2.5x2.5 degree latitude/longitude in netcdf format. This CDR is key to understanding water vapor feedback climatology and has been used to study long-term water vapor variability, to evaluate climate models, and to study large-scale atmospheric circulations.",gov.noaa.ncdc.C00951,ACTIVE,Not provided,,,,-90.0,90.0,-180.0,180.0,"POLYGON ((180 -90, 180 90, -180 90, -180 -90, 180 -90))"

      NOAA-N Prime will be the last in the series of TIROS ATN. NOAA-N' has a planned launch date of February 2009 from Vandenberg AFB, CA by a Delta II launch vehicle.
      
      The spacecraft will continue to provide a polar-orbiting platform to support (1) environmental monitoring instruments for imaging and measuring the Earth's atmosphere, its surface, and cloud cover, including Earth radiation, atmospheric ozone, aerosol distribution, sea surface temperature, and vertical temperature and water profiles in the troposphere and stratosphere; (2) measurement of proton and electron flux at orbit altitude; (3) data collection from remote platforms; and (4) the Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking (SARSAT) system.
      
      Additionally, NOAA-N' will be the fifth in the series of support dedicated microwave instruments for the generation of temperature, moisture, surface, and hydrological products in cloudy regions where visible and infrared (IR) instruments have decreased capability.
      
      This spacecraft will carry an Advanced - DCS instead of the previous DCS.

Extent of Coverage - The AVHRR sensor provides for global (pole to pole) on
board collection of data from all 5 spectral channels. Each pass of the
satellite provides a 2399 km wide swath. The satellite orbits the Earth 14
times each day from 833 km above its surface.

AVHRR data are acquired in three formats:

1-High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT)-HRPT data are full resolution
image data transmitted to a ground station as they are collected.

2-Local Area Coverage (LAC)-LAC are also full resolution data, but recorded
with an on-board tape recorder for subsequent transmission during a station
overpass.

3-Global Area Coverage (GAC)-GAC data provide daily subsampled global coverage
recorded on the tape recorders and then transmitted to a ground station.

The data are collected in several scientific centers:
-USGS/Earth Resources Observation Systems (EROS) data center (EDC);
-NOAA/NESDIS - National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service
of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration;
