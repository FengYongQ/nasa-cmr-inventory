		<SimpleData name="coll_version">The SPURS (Salinity Processes in the Upper Ocean Regional Study) project is an oceanographic process study and associated field program that aim to elucidate key mechanisms responsible for near-surface salinity variations in the oceans. The project involves two field campaigns and a series of cruises in regions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans exhibiting salinity extremes.  SPURS employs a suite of state-of-the-art in-situ sampling technologies that, combined with remotely sensed salinity fields from the Aquarius/SAC-D and SMOS satellites, provide a detailed characterization of salinity structure over a continuum of spatio-temporal scales.  The SPURS-1 campaign involved a series of 5 cruises during 2012 - 2013 seeking to characterize the salinity structure and balance in a high salinity, high evaporation, and low rainfall region of the subtropical North Atlantic. It aims to resolve processes responsible for maintaining the subtropical surface salinity maximum in this region and within a 900 x 800-mile square study area centered at 25N, 38W.  Part of the Argo global network of autonomous, self-reporting samplers, Argo floats drift horizontally and move vertically through the water column generally on 10 day cycles, collecting high-quality temperature, conductivity and salinity depth profiles from the upper 2000m. Approximately 24 floats were deployed during SPURS-1 within the campaign domain, mainly during the Knorr cruise (6 Sept-9 Oct,2012). These were standard Argo floats with the addition of surface temperature and salinity (STS) sensors and acoustic rain gauges (PAL). Data accessible here only include the standard ARGO profiles, not the STS or PAL data. SPURS-1 ARGO data files are oganized per float and each contain  profile trajectory series  of conductivity, salinity, temperature, pressure, depth observations.</SimpleData>

Drifter buoys contain GPS/ARGOS and satellite data transmitters, with sensors measuring temperature and other properties. For SPURS-1, these were standard Surface Velocity Program (SVP) drifters with salinity sensors added (SVP/S). Data for both US and European drifter deployments during SPURS-1 are available here.  For each series, drifter data have been aggregrated within single netCDF data filea with their corresponding drifter-IDs and associaciated near-surface salinity, temperaure georeferenced (GPS and ARGOS) trajectory series data.</SimpleData>

The Seasoar is a towed vehicle equipped with impeller-forced wings that can be rotated on command to allow the vehicle to undulate in the upper ocean. Generally, Seasoar operates between the surface and about 400 meters depth while being towed on faired cable at about eight knots. A typical dive cycle takes about 12 minutes to complete, providing an up and down profile every 3 km.  For SPURS-1, a Seasoar was deployed exclusively during the Sarmiento cruise over the period 22 Mar-8 Apr, 2013 and to a maximum depth of 312m.  The Seasoar towed sensor system was equipped with dual pumped temperature/conductivity sensors.  The Seasoar data in netCDF form here contains a highly processed 1-meter gridded version of the original source dataset, which is comprised of temperature, conductivity, salinity, pressure observations from 1144 casts during 2013 Spring SPURS Cruise.</SimpleData>

It aims to resolve processes responsible for maintaining the subtropical surface salinity maximum in this region and within a 900 x 800-mile square study area centered at 25N, 38W. All US SPURS-1 cruises (Knorr: 6 Sept-9 Oct 2012; Endeavor: 15 Mar-15 Apr 2013 and 19 Sep-13 Oct 2013) were equipped with a ship mast meteorological sensor package. An additional set of sophisticated meteorological sensors, including a direct covariance flux package, was installed on the Knorr. These sensors provided along-track atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, IR/visible radiation, rain, wind speed and direct covariance flux measurements.  Resulting data files (1 per cruise) contain these georeferenced, SPURS-1 research vessel-based meteorological measurements.</SimpleData>

The Controlled Flux Technique (CFT) is a system for measuring the net heat transfer velocity and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation at the ocean surface, and is a useful tool for studying the turbulence generated at the ocean surface by the impact of raindrops. CFT was employed during both SPURS-2 Revelle cruises. It involves a laser heating a small patch of water on the ocean surface, and an infrared imaging camera then tracking the resulting thermal decay.  This decay is known to be proportional to the dissipation of TKE at the water surface, which in turn can be used to scale the transfer velocity for the net heat flux. SPURS2 CFT data take the form of a series of .raw video files each with corresponding .met text header files containing the associated file metadata.  The CFT data was recorded at 15 frames per second (fps) during the first Revelle cruise in 2016, and at 25 fps during the second in 2017.  Matlab CFT reader software are provided by UW/APL and distributed here with the CFT data files.</SimpleData>

		<SimpleData name="coll_version">The SPURS (Salinity Processes in the Upper Ocean Regional Study) project is a NASA-funded oceanographic process study and associated field program that aim to elucidate key mechanisms responsible for near-surface salinity variations in the oceans. The project is comprised of two field campaigns and a series of cruises in regions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans exhibiting salinity extremes. SPURS employs a suite of state-of-the-art in-situ sampling technologies that, combined with remotely sensed salinity fields from the Aquarius/SAC-D, SMAP and SMOS satellites, provide a detailed characterization of salinity structure over a continuum of spatio-temporal scales. The SPURS-2 campaign involved two month-long cruises by the R/V Revelle in August 2016 and October 2017 combined with complementary sampling on a more continuous basis over this period by the schooner Lady Amber. Focused around a central mooring located near 10N,125W, the objective of SPURS-2 was to study the dynamics of the rainfall-dominated surface ocean at the western edge of the eastern Pacific fresh pool subject to high seasonal variability and strong zonal flows associated with the North Equatorial Current and Countercurrent. Two PICO moorings (PMEL 9N and 11N) were deployed on the Revelle cruise in September 2016 in northern and southern domain quadrants at 9deg2.830N, 124deg59.833W and N10:59.0498, W124:57.531 respectively. These moorings contained a surface meteorological package and a &quot;prawler&quot;, a CTD that crawls up and down the mooring line from 4-450m, yielding time series of salinity and temperature profile data at fixed locations (nominally 8 profiles per day). The moorings were recovered on the second Revelle cruise (Oct. 22 &amp; Nov. 2, 2017). PICO mooring netCDF files contain georeferenced CTD profile data including salinity, temperature, potential temperature, pressure, depth, surface meteorological package data, GPS-Lat/Lon, and profile ID.</SimpleData>

Focused around a central mooring located near 10N,125W, the objective of SPURS-2 was to study the dynamics of the rainfall-dominated surface ocean at the western edge of the eastern Pacific fresh pool subject to high seasonal variability and strong zonal flows associated with the North Equatorial Current and Countercurrent. Underway surface profiling systems (USPS) are automated measurement systems coupled to a research vessels water intake and GPS systems. They provide continuous, along-track surface temperature and salinity measurements at depths of 2, 3 and 5 m using through-hull ports in the bow of the ship. Both SPURS-2 cruises had USPS and associated thermosalinograph (TSG) instrumentation, with measurements calibrated against onboard salinometers. There is one USPS netCDF containing the complete series for each of the 2 cruises.</SimpleData>

		<SimpleData name="coll_version">The SPURS (Salinity Processes in the Upper Ocean Regional Study) project is an oceanographic process study and associated field program that aim to elucidate key mechanisms responsible for near-surface salinity variations in the oceans. The project involves two field campaigns and a series of cruises in regions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans exhibiting salinity extremes.  SPURS employs a suite of state-of-the-art in-situ sampling technologies that, combined with remotely sensed salinity fields from the Aquarius/SAC-D and SMOS satellites, provide a detailed characterization of salinity structure over a continuum of spatio-temporal scales.  The SPURS-1 campaign involved a series of 5 cruises during 2012 - 2013 seeking to characterize the salinity structure and balance in a high salinity, high evaporation, and low rainfall region of the subtropical North Atlantic. It aims to resolve processes responsible for maintaining the subtropical surface salinity maximum in this region and within a 900 x 800-mile square study area centered at 25N, 38W. The SPURS central mooring consisted of a surface meteorological package, surface oceanographic instruments, and subsurface, non-real time oceanographic instruments including CTD, ADCP sensors and current meters providing continuous series of temperature, salinity and current profile observations. Meteorological observations include wind speed, air temperature, precipitation, and radiative flux. The mooring was deployed in 5,535 meters of water at N24:34.867, W38 on 14 September 2012, was serviced on 25 March 2013 and recovered on 30 September 2013.  WHOI mooring  data files include surface and subsurface time series  of sea temperature, skin temperature, salinity, conductivity, wind velocity, air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation rate, barometric pressure, shortwave and longwave radiation, short/longwave flux, heat Flux, wind Speed and direction.</SimpleData>
