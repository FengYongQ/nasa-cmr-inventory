Data for the three estimates are provided in both ASCII text and in NetCDF formatted files. ED is an individual-based terrestrial ecosystem model that predicts both ecosystem structure (e.g. above and below-ground biomass, vegetation height and basal area, and soil carbon stocks) and corresponding ecosystem fluxes (e.g. NPP, NEP and evapotranspiration) from climate, soil, and land-use inputs. The model consists of integrated sub-models governing processes such as leaf-level physiology, plant allocation, allometry, phenology, dispersal, the effects of fire disturbances, and below-ground sub-models for soil carbon dynamics and hydrology. Using a new method for scaling-up it is possible to predict ED's large-scale behavior without simulating the fate of every plant individually. ED is used to examine how climate and edaphic factors, natural disturbances, and human land-use practices affect ecosystem structure and fluxes.

A mosaic image of biomass at 240 m resolution for the whole conterminous U.S. is also included.Please read this important note regarding the differences of Version 2 from Version 1 of the NBCD 2000 data. With Version 1, in some mapping zones, certain land cover types (in particular Shrubs, NLCD Type 52) were missing from and unaccounted for in modeled estimates because of a lack of reference data. In Version 1, when landcover types were missing in the models, the model for the deciduous tree cover type was applied. While more woody vegetation was mapped, the authors think this had little effect on model performance as in most cases NLCD version 1 cover type was not a strong predictor of modeled estimates (See companion Mapping Zone Readme files). In Version 2, after renewed modeling efforts and user feedback, these previously unaccounted for cover types are now included in modeled estimates.All 66 mapping zones were updated with the previously unmapped land cover types now mapped. The authors recommend use of the new version for all analyses and will only support the updated version.Development of the data set used an empirical modeling approach that combined USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data with high-resolution InSAR data acquired from the 2000 Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and optical remote sensing data acquired from the Landsat ETM+ sensor. Three-season Landsat ETM+ data were systematically compiled by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC) between 1999 and 2002 for the entire U.S. and were the foundation for development of both the USGS National Land Cover Dataset 2001 (NLCD 2001) and the Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools Project (LANDFIRE). Products from both the NLCD 2001 (landcover and canopy density) and LANDFIRE (existing vegetation type) projects as well as topographic information from the USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED) were used within the NBCD 2000 project as spatial predictor layers for canopy height and biomass estimation. Forest survey data provided by the USDA Forest Service FIA program were made available to the project under a national Memorandum of Understanding. The response variables (canopy height and biomass) used in model development and validation were derived from the FIA database (FIADB). Production of the NLCD 2001 and LANDFIRE projects was based on a mapping zone approach in which the conterminous U.S. was split into 66 ecoregionally distinct mapping zones. This mapping zone approach was also adopted by the NBCD 2000 project.

The data are gridded footprints on a 1-km grid congruent with the ACES emissions inventory. Meteorological fields from version 3.5.1 of the Weather Research and Forecasting model are used to drive STILT. STILT applies a Lagrangian particle dispersion model backwards in time from a measurement location (the ""receptor"" location), to create the adjoint of the transport model in the form of a ""footprint"" field.
